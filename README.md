Introduction to R + OSM
=======================

This is a workshop put together by Angela Li of the [Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS)](https://spatial.uchicago.edu) at UChicago for [State of the Map 2018](https://2018.stateofthemap.us).

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this workshop, workshop attendees should be able to:

1.  Install useful R packages
2.  Download OSM data from the OpenStreetMap API, using the `osmdata` R package
3.  Map downloaded OSM data in R
4.  Understand the two formats in which R stores spatial data

⭐️ Do This Now! ⭐️
------------------

### Install Necessary Packages

Open RStudio and paste the following code into your console, then press Enter to run it:

``` r
# Download packages from CRAN
install.packages(c("devtools", "knitr", "magrittr", "sf", "sp", "rmarkdown", "usethis", "osmdata"))
```

### Download Lesson Materials

Download this entire lesson (all code, notebooks, and data) to your computer desktop by running the following code in your RStudio console. Respond `yes` to all prompts:

``` r
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/angela-li/sotmus-r/archive/master.zip")
```

Once you've downloaded this lesson, open the `.Rproj` file to get started.

Use the `sotmus-r-complete.Rmd` notebook as a guide to fill out the `sotmus-r.Rmd` lesson notebook.

Contents
--------

-   [`code`](https://github.com/angela-li/sotmus-r/tree/master/code): Raw R code generated from notebooks
-   [`data`](https://github.com/angela-li/sotmus-r/tree/master/data): Intermediate R data objects (to be used in case of bad Internet connection)
-   [`notebooks`](https://github.com/angela-li/sotmus-r/tree/master/notebooks): R Markdown notebooks with R code, produced during workshop. Includes empty notebook (`sotmus-r.html`) and filled-out notebook (`sotmus-r-complete.html`).
-   [`slides`](https://github.com/angela-li/sotmus-r/tree/master/slides): Intro slides (there are only 2 because I worked live in the `sotmus-r.Rmd` notebook)

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you're running into issues with RTools (mostly Windows users), check out this [solution on Github](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1772#issuecomment-393669488).

Typing ? before your R command in the console will bring up function documentation in R.
